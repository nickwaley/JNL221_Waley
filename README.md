		<h2>Men's Vs. Women's World Cup</h2>
		<p class="subhed">The attendcne figures for sport's biggest competitions</p>
		<p class="byline">By Nicholas Waley</p>
		
		<p>The world cup is the most watched sporting event on the planet. The FIFA Men's World Cup has had over a billion people watch the world cup finals. Since its first tournment in 1930, the FIFA World Cup has only grown since until the 2010s. The Women's World Cup has only been around since 1991. The viewership and attendence doesn't surpass the Men's but has grown at a rate that's even faster.</p>
		<p>In recent news, the question of attendence and pay disparency for both competitions has come into question. Considering how million travel to the world cup on the men's side and only a few hundred thousand travel for the women's, the question is why this is the case.</p>
